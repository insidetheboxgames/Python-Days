# 30 Days of Python
## This repo details my code from my experience learning python over 30 days
## My Reasoning for this:
My experience is in C and C++, as such I haven't had as much experience in a language like python. When deciding what language I wanted to learn next I went back and forth between quite a few different options: Ruby, Typescript, Lua, Go. However I've wanted to learn python for a while and I appreciate the adaptability of the language.
## What I'm following for this:
I using [GitHub - Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python: 30 days of Python ](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/tree/master) as my center focus of my learning.
## Some Exceptions
I may miss a day due to other classwork from my education
